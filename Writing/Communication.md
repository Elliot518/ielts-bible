- Scnario 1: Programmer and Logistics company boss

    > One of the challenges in communication between people lies in the gap of knowledge, like when you have two individuals from different fields, such as a programmer and a logistics company boss. The programmer has IT skills that the logistics boss lacks, while the logistics boss possesses business knowledge in the logistics domain that the programmer doesn't understand. When they communicate with each other, it's crucial to play to each other's strengths. The programmer shouldn't express his ideas using technical jargon because what seems straightforward to him might be complex and difficult for the other person to grasp. Therefore, he should try to empathize and convey his thoughts in a simple and understandable manner for more effective communication.

    人与人之间沟通的挑战之一在于知识的差距，就像当你有两个来自不同领域的人时，例如程序员和物流公司老板。程序员拥有物流老板所缺乏的IT技能，而物流老板则拥有程序员不懂的物流领域的业务知识。当他们相互交流时，发挥彼此的优势至关重要。程序员不应该使用技术术语来表达他的想法，因为对他来说看似简单的事情可能对其他人来说复杂且难以理解。因此，他应该尽量换位思考，用简单易懂的方式表达自己的想法，以便更有效地沟通。
